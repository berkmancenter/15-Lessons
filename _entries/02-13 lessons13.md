The fact that the Berkman Center is at Harvard University bestows bene ts. Most are replicable at least to some degree.

Harvard’s convening power is awesome, enabling projects that otherwise would be dif cult, and bringing fellows into contact with leading voices from outside the pro- gram. But any fellows program has convening power, especially if it becomes known for putting on worthwhile events. Colin Maclay says, “When you ask someone what a Berkman event’s like, they say it’s fun, really smart people, engaging, unique.” That sort of reputation makes it much easier to get people to come to an event.

The Center has found it relatively easy to attract partners, undoubtedly in part due to the Harvard name. But none of those partnerships would have succeeded if the Cen- ter—and its fellows—had not been friendly, open, respectful, and a fun partner. These are qualities available to all centers, and for which Harvard has not always been noted.
Because of the Center’s origins at Harvard Law School, it has always enabled fellows

to look at their work in light of policy. But every fellows program is embedded in an environment that has its own strengths. Former fellow Dan Gillmor advises, “What’s the unique advantage that your location has, including in expertise? Leverage that.”

Being part of Harvard means the Center has access to administrative resources that help it function at a high level. For example, the Center works with Harvard’s Interna- tional Of ce to secure visa paperwork for international community members. The program also bene ts from University resources such as libraries, extracurricular opportunities, and the wider intellectual community.

Prof. Zittrain notes: “It helps to be at a major research university that culturally has a laissez faire attitude. There are a lot of rafters for the mice to run around in here.” Other centers can likewise strive to create open spaces in terms of expectations, norms, and structure.
