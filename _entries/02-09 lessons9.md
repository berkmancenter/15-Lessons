The commitment to building things—primarily software and organizations—goes back to the very origins of the Center. “Charlie [Nesson] emphasized that from the begin- ning,” says Prof. Zittrain, adding that it is a concrete way that the Center can have an impact. As fellow Sara Watson puts it, “The Berkman way is to say, ‘Let’s make some- thing happen,’ instead of just thinking about it or criticizing it.”
Building things has at least three bene ts for the Center and the Fellows Program.
First, as early fellow Wendy Seltzer says, “There are lots of pieces of Internet research that can only be done by constructing things and seeing how they work.” She adds, with understatement, “That’s not always supported by academics. If it’s not a paper it doesn’t count in many other places.”
Second, selecting fellows in part for their ability to build things brings into the program people with deep technical understanding that grounds conversations in what is cur- rently practical and a realistic sense of what is achievable.
Third, building things attracts activists and researchers with activist leanings, enriching the mix.
