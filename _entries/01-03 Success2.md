title: What Constitutes Success for the Fellows Program, the Fellow's view
number: 1300
---
The Berkman community members interviewed for this report expressed a remarkably consistent idea of what constitutes a successful fellowship from a fellow’s point of view.

## The work

Success consists in making progress on the project one came in with—or the version of that project that emerged over the course of the year.

## Cohort

“The program has felt the most successful when it has felt the most coherent, when there is a real cohort,” says fellow Andrew Lowenthal. “That creates the strong relationships that enables projects, ideas, conversation, collaborations…”

## Engagement

Former Managing Director Colin Maclay says a successful fellow is engaged with the community, “sharing ideas, reflecting on the ideas of others, and ideally producing something from those sets of ideas.”

## Continuing network

The success of the program is measured also in its plugging fellows into a larger network, including the alumni network. The primary vehicle for this is the very active BerkmanFriends listserv that brings together current appointees, alumni, and other friends of the Center. Recently the Center has begun hosting alumni events, including an informal meetup in San Francisco and a brunch with alumni in Menlo Park.

As fellow Sands Fish says, “I see the success of the fellowship as having a network that I can communicate with.”

That network extends beyond Berkman and beyond one’s term as a fellow. Former fellow Kit Walsh says, “Connections mean you’re situated going forward outside of the Center. The benefits continue.”

## Diversity

Fellow Willow Brugh, Community Leadership Strategist at Aspiration, points to the encounters with people she would otherwise not have met. “Without serendipity, difference, contention we can’t change anything.”

What counts as diverse of course depends on where one starts. Fellow Emy Tseng, who comes from a background of government and philanthropy, comments, “Being able to participate in an academic community but not as an academic has been very valuable.” Fellow Ellery Biddle, with a background in nonprofits and journalism, notes that she also had never been part of academia before. “The idea of teaching never seemed like a realistic possibility, and it does now.” Fellow Matthew Battles, Associate Director of metaLAB, a digital humanities research team, says, “I’ve particularly enjoyed learning from attorneys, an extraordinary immersion in a kind of discourse I haven’t participated in.”

## Freedom

The freedom to explore one’s interests even if they change in the course of the exploration has been an important criterion of success for many fellows. Fellow Primavera De Filippi says that she “would not have had the courage to pursue” her blockchain research if she had not felt supported in that exploration. In fact, she found this liberty to be transformative: “I did things I would have not done before because I didn’t believe they would have taken off.”

## Credibility

Former fellow Hasit Shah notes that “it opens doors”: “If you can say you come from a place like this, it helps.”

Or, as Willow Brugh puts it: “Before I moved to Cambridge, I was fairly bad ass. I was having plenty of the impacts that I hoped to have. But becoming an affiliate of the Center showed me what as a blue-haired woman it’s like to have institutional credibility.”
