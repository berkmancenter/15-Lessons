From the very inception of the Berkman Center, the Fellows Program has been core to the Center’s vision.

The program has transformed itself several times, each iteration succeeding beyond expectations. There are, however, some constants:

+ A set of values consistent with the phenomenon the Center studies. A culture that embodies those values.

+ A community that forms itself around that culture—but only because enormous atten- tion has been paid to enabling that community to form and reform every year.

+ A sense of perspective that remembers the human elements, including commitment, supportiveness, spontaneity, emergence, kindness, and fun.

+ A staff that is as committed to the values and pursuits of the Center as are the fellows they support.

+ A commitment to the hard work it takes to create an experience for fellows that is organic and emergent.

“It is a lot of work,” says Executive Director Gasser. “But it’s a truly collaborative project. It takes a lot of people who want to make this happen, and who come together to do the work and make their unique contributions.”
