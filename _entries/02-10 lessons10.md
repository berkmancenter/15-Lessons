“The Center is not going to take positions, and we embrace dissent.”

So states former Managing Director Colin Maclay. For example, during the days of the SOPA/PIPA debate that ultimately led to Google, Reddit, Wikipedia and other major sites “going dark,” the Center’s site stayed open. Indeed, there was vigorous debate among the fellows and the faculty about the meaning and wisdom of online copyright and intellectual property policies.

There was less debate, however, about whether the openness of the Net was prima facie good, and whether access to the Net ought to be broadened and dis- tributed more fairly. The Center from its beginning has embraced a set of values. Prof. Nesson, in recalling the founding days of the Center, puts it in terms of justice: it is unfair for only privileged groups to have the ability to ex- press themselves and to connect with others.

Standing for something brings crucial bene ts: It is a way of taking responsibility for the fact that values inhere at any research center. It af liates people who are able to accomplish things together over the short space of an academic year. Perhaps most important, it reminds fellows that something is at stake, that their work should make a difference.

The Center recognizes that it is a tricky balance, but one worth striving for. Berkman’s commitment to building things entails making decisions about what to build based on their intended outcomes. But as an academic center, Berkman is also absolutely com- mitted to pursuing research regardless of the conclusions to which it may lead, as well as fostering respectful engagements with those who do not share its values. As Execu- tive Director Gasser puts it, “Yes, there is a set of broadly de ned core values, but one of the core values is the openness and honesty to look at realities, to study them, and understand them.”

He points to two factors that help the Center  nd its balance. First, “The fellows are key. They keep us honest.” Second, “We shouldn’t forget the surrounding stakeholders: the foundations, donors, policy makers, NGOs, and partners—external voices who bring their issues to us. That creates another set of checks and balances.”
