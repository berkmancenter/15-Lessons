title: What Constitutes Success for the Fellows Program, the Center's view
---

What makes a year successful from a fellow’s point of view is not necessarily the same as what makes the Fellows Program a success from the Center’s point of view. We will consider each separately, although they of course overlap.

Indeed, Executive Director Urs Gasser considers the overlap to be at the heart of the Fellows Program: “At the highest level, the way I look at it, the program is successful if over time we can keep some sort of symbiotic balance between what the fellows give to the Center and what they receive from it.”

**Impact**
When asked what constitutes the success of the Fellows Program for the Center, Prof. Zittrain points immediately to the “impact on the world.” Examples include Chilling Effects (Lumen), StopBadWare, Internet Moni-
tor, Perma.cc, Media Cloud, the OpenNet Initiative, the Global Network of Centers, the Harvard Open Access Project, and others, some of which were initiated by fellows, but all of which were sig- ni cantly shaped by the fellows supporting them.

The impact of the program goes beyond the effect of institutional projects like those. It is felt also in how the Center’s resources and the cohort’s engagement make the fellows’ independent projects more effective. This can happen because the fellows are able to test ideas at the Center, convene collaborators from other institutions, re ne public and scholarly communications, learn from the methodologies of the institutional projects and one another, and interact with the faculty.

Creative Commons is an example of another criterion of success: the Center’s willingness to let ideas grow and fail: “Creative Commons gestated here and went through some transitions,” Prof. Zittrain points out. “In some ways, it failed several times be- fore it succeeded.”

The willingness to take risks means, he says, that “you have to look at the portfolio” to as- sess the success of the Fellows Program as a source of research and development. “Some proj- ects don’t pay out for  ve or six years.”

**Quality of research**

The Center has high standards for the quality of the research it pursues as an institution and the research done by its fellows. That research can take many forms. Rob Faris, the Center’s Research Director, says, “As with many other aspects of the Center, its de nition and practice of research challenges tradition- al boundaries. It encompasses traditional academic methods and approaches, but it also in- cludes experimental approaches, tool-building, and a willingness to take on novel and risky areas of inquiry.” He adds, “The  ow of ideas between fellows and the core research teams productively blurs the lines between them, which brings together rigorous methodologies and fresh ap- proaches and perspectives.”

Faris says, “The Center is defined by its research. And the active involvement of the fellows com- munity makes it unique.”

**Quality of conversation**

Jon Murley, Financial Manager, says, “A lot of the success boils down to the vigor of the intel- lectual community. There are amazing conversations,” which he attributes to “the passion people have for what they’re do- ing.” In interviews for this report it was often stated that for the conversations to be successful they have to present multiple perspectives and engage people more than just intellectually.

The quality of that conversation depends upon not only the strengths and character of the individual fellows but upon the work that forms the common basis for social interchange at the Center. As Wendy Seltzer says, “The people who have more suc- cess here are the ones who are willing to talk about anything with anyone and to think in different ways.”

To get the most from this spirit of openness, the Center strives for multi-modal diversity in each cohort of fellows.

**Effect on other networks and centers**

The Center sees the Fellows Pro- gram as a way to seed research, collaborative projects, and activism throughout the Internet ecosystem. This occurs through collaboration with other groups; the inevitable diaspora of fellows every year; the spread of ideas through open-access publish- ing, open source software, and publications in a variety of media; and through partners such as the Global Network of Centers that the Berkman Center was instru- mental in founding.

In addition, fellow Malavika Jayaram points out that one of the greatest successes of the Fellows Program is how many other sim- ilar centers it has inspired, often involving former Berkman fel- lows. For example, former fellow danah boyd credits the Center with helping to in uence Data & Society, the “think/do tank” she founded.

**Staying weird**

Especially as the Fellows Pro- gram has grown, there has been an explicit emphasis, including in Prof. Zittrain’s inaugural talk to the staff and fellows, on “Keeping Berkman weird.” The presence of non-academic fellows, including musicians and other artists, is a point of pride, as well as a point of distinction. Zittrain points to the Center’s collaboration with ro CON, a series of conferences celebrating the very non-aca- demic side of Internet culture.

**Quality of life**

Prof. Nesson says that when eval- uating the success of the Fellows Program in institutional terms, he prefers not to focus on a list of accomplishments but instead to look at whether the program is “really satisfying, with really interesting people” who are “en- gaging with issues of the Internet and society on many fronts.”
