title: A Good Day to be a Berkman Fellow
---
On any particular Tuesday morning in the spring semester of 2015, in the Victorian house the Berkman Center shares with a handful of other Harvard organizations, you would have been likely to find Berkman Fellows hanging out in one of the rather small public areas, laptops open and earbuds plugged in, or talking with other fellows in the kitchen or lounge area. Others might be working at home, attending a class or event at the University, or enjoying Cambridge — especially if the Tuesday was after this winter’s epic high tide of snow had ebbed.

At noon the fellows gather for the Tuesday talk, usually featuring a guest or a fellow. The attendees from the Center and the community routinely over ow into the Center’s small lounge. Attendees try to finish the lunch the Center provides before the speaker throws the session open for discussion.

At two o’clock, the fellows assemble for the only regularly scheduled time for all of them to be alone together. The format varies, and the discussions are usually spirited.

At four, the fellows drift into smaller informal groups. Some go back to their individual work or to the collaborative projects at the center of their fellowships. It’s quite possible that an email has been sent to their mailing list inviting any and all to assemble for a meal at a local restaurant or, increasingly commonly, at the one of fellows’ homes where a meal will be prepared, usually collaboratively.

At the end of the day, the fellows will have worked at their own paces, had lively conversations with colleagues, been stimulated by a talk from an expert likely out of their own field, engaged in cross-disciplinary discussions in a group of the whole, discovered a new shop or pub in Harvard Square, deepened social bonds at an informal dinner, and been stretched in purposeful and serendipitous ways.
