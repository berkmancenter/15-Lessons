The Berkman Center is led by an active board of Faculty Directors, chaired currently by Jonathan Zittrain. The Executive Director, Urs Gasser, is a faculty member who in this capacity reports to the Board.

There is a permanent staff of around forty. A small but significant staff reorganization last year established project leaders for clusters of projects.

The Centerâ€™s core activities are funded by the Berkman family, Harvard Law School, and the MacArthur Foundation. General support comes from foundations, non-profits, and governmental agencies. Individuals and corporations also contribute unrestricted gifts.

The Center does not confer degrees or offer courses for credit.
