title: Let the Sociality Emerge

The Center provides many opportunities for social engagement. But over the past three years there has been a noticeable uptick in the social occasions Berkman fellows create for themselves. The mailing list for current fellows frequently has posts organizing ad hoc social events, including outings and dinners at fellowsâ€™ residences.

These events build a sense of community. They enable fellows to get to know one another better. They are an occasion for deeper dives into topics that might not be of more general interest. They enable a more personal discourse, with more risk-taking than public engagements make comfortable. They enable more inter-disciplinary, ser- endipitous discussions. They make people better collaborators.

This sociality arose organically. It is now part of the culture and has already been passed on from one cohort to another, primarily by the continuing fellows.
