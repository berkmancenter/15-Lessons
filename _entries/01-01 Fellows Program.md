The Fellows Program is embedded in a research center at which serious scholarly work is already underway. Some of the fellows work directly on those existing projects, although most come in with their own projects. Nevertheless, there is a pervasive sense that one is living amidst persistent, high-quality research programs that provide implicit models for fellows as well as being a source of information and ideas.

Fellowships are for one academic year (September-May) although the term can be extended, especially if the fellow is working on a multi-year institutional project. Harvard University does not permit fellowships to be extended indefinitely.

There are two main types of fellowships: employee fellowships and non-employee fellowships.

Employee fellows are paid a stipend to work on one of the Berkman Center’s institutional research projects or initiatives led by the Center’s faculty directors, which are the “tent poles” of the Center. They provide some persistence to the intellectual life of the Fellows Program, connecting people and ideas across different areas of the Center. Effectively, the fellowship is their ‘day job’. There are two tiers of stipends for full time employee fellows, $48,000 and $64,000, depending on the experience, expertise, and background of the fellow. The number of employee fellows each year varies depending on the needs of the Center’s projects, but typically ranges between 8-10.

Non-employee fellows contribute to the research, life, and activity of the Center primarily through advancing research of their own design while in the context of the community. Non-employee fellows often have other jobs or appointments during their fellowships, while being committed to actively participating in Center activities. Non-employee fellows may contribute to and learn from the Center’s projects. Most non-employee fellows receive no direct funding or stipend through the Berkman Center, but rather have obtained funding through other means, such as an outside grant or award, a home institution, or other forms of scholarship. As the Center’s About page says, “Some fellows receive partial stipends based on the nature of their responsibilities and their relation, relevance, and application to Berkman’s funded projects.”3

Fellows are expected to actively conduct research and contribute to the Center’s intellectual community. They often start with working on the research they proposed in their application, although non-employee fellows are free to modify or even replace their initial projects. There are no strict requirements for non-employee fellows’ output.

Fellows are expected to reside in the Cambridge area for the full term of their fellowship. They are encouraged to come to the Tuesday lunchtime talks and are expected to attend the two-hour Fellows Hour later that afternoon. Fellows are encouraged to work out of the Center and are welcome to use the Center’s open workspaces or to work wherever they feel most comfortable. There are some dedicated offices for shared use and co-working by the fellows, although non-employee fellows are not given their own individual dedicated desk or office.

There are several types of relationships that extend the community beyond the circle of current fellows, including:

Affiliates: Former fellows or people with whom the Center would like to maintain a relationship.

Faculty Associates: An affiliate with a faculty appointment at another school.

The Fellows Advisory Board consists of a small group of former fellows who have maintained involvement with the Center.

The selection process

Each fall, the Center puts out an open call for fellowship applications. The Center then works to get the call heard widely, asking people in its community to share the opportunity with their extended networks. Although the application site has a lot of information, including a FAQ4 page, the staff fields many questions from prospective applicants.

The staff does an initial, thorough review of the applications, looking for matches to existing research areas as well as for individual contributors whose expertise and interests will add to the mix. The Center strives for a balance across multiple factors, always thinking about the applicants’ effect on the community. In fact, the selection process aims at selecting a community, not individuals. While Rebecca Tabasky, Manager of Community Programs, says, “We try to find people who are no less thoughtful than the luminaries, but who are yet to be discovered,” she also emphasizes the personal characteristics the Center looks for.

While reviewing the new applicants, the Center also works to identify which current community members will maintain an affiliation the following year.

Many of the promising new candidates will receive a phone call from the staff that is intended not only to share information about the program and to gather some more information about the candidate’s interests, but also to identify people who are particularly collaborative. Amar Ashar, Manager of Strategic Initiatives, says, “We look for markers that they know how to build things together with others, and are enabled by being in a community.”

Executive Director Urs Gasser stresses the seriousness with which the Center approaches the selection process: “Every year we have a multi-dimensional mapping exercise, grouping people into clusters and trying to figure out who are the connectors to other clusters. There’s quite a bit of planning and engineering involved.” But this is in service to a humane commitment: “Ultimately it’s all about people and the spirit you can help create around them.”

The staff sends their fellowship recommendations to the Board of Directors for review and approval. This part of the review and selection process takes place in early spring.

Once the Board of Directors has approved the fellowship selections, there are still additional steps:

Offer letters are sent out to prospective fellows, and fellows must affirmatively confirm that they accept the fellowship and its conditions. Because people’s situations can change between the time they apply and the time they receive the fellowship offer, it is important for prospective fellows and the Center to work through any questions or issues fellows have. Rebecca Tabasky often has another round of queries and conversations from prospective fellows at this stage in the process. Sometimes people who have received fellowship offers decline; others end up accepting roles as faculty associates or affiliates, for which the expectations are more fluid.

All told, the fellowship selection process takes nearly a full academic year.

Employee fellows work on a number of important projects and initiatives at the Center and help strengthen its global networks. Recent examples include a report on designing successful governance groups co-authored by staff fellow Ryan Budish as part of the Internet Governance project, a report on emerging privacy issues in K-12 education, authored by the Student Privacy project team, including project fellows Paulina Haduong and Leah Plunkett, as well as the Digitally Connected network led by fellow Sandra Cortesi in collaboration with UNICEF. Employee fellows also contribute to a National Science Foundation project on Privacy, the Municipal Fiber and Media Cloud projects, as well as the work of the Cyberlaw Clinic. In the past, fellows played key roles in the Center’s Open Access project and the Open Net Initiative.
